        We used a variety of methods for our development process including working remotely,
        meeting up either all together, in small groups, or as partners, and communicating
        through Facebook messanger about different ideas and progress reports. We used a 
        variety of methods for our development process including working remotely, meeting 
        up either all together, in small groups, or as partners, and communicating through 
        Facebook messenger about different ideas and progress reports. During our in person 
        group meetings, we would discuss what the current status of our visualization, 
        problems that we were having, and what needed to be done next. After agreeing on 
        this to do list, everyone in the group would pick a task off of this list to work 
        on. Using this development process, work was split evenly while still giving each 
        team member their own features to work on. Alexis’s tasks were mainly data wrangling 
        and bounding the data to the bar graph. Shayan’s tasks mostly had to do with the 
        timeline filter and the country flag customization. Anirudh’s was in 
        charge of the tooltip interaction technique and Ethan was in charge of tasks 
        surrounding the important UX design features. Zachary’s tasks were mainly managing 
        code integration and refactoring the code to help our different interaction 
        techniques work together smoothly. Collectively we spent about 50 hours developing 
        our application. The aspects that took the most time were the data wrangling, 
        bounding the data to the bar graph using d3, and integrating the timeline with the 
        bar graph. Spotify charts only lets you download data for one day and for one 
        country at a time; therefore, we had to write python scripts that would fetch this 
        data for each day in 2019 and compile it into one csv for each country, which took 
        several hours to run. Bounding the data and integrating the timeline with the bar 
        graph was time consuming not only because it was difficult, but also because this 
        was our first time using d3. 
        <br><br>
        We explored several other designs before finally deciding on the visual encodings 
        and interaction techniques that you see on our webpage. Before we decided on the 
        timeline interaction technique, we experimented with a date dropdown menu with 
        everyday in 2019. We decided to go with the timeline instead of the dropdown 
        because we wanted to be able to show song streaming trends over time, and it was 
        easier to transition between days with the slider. We also experimented with using 
        a map to filter the data by country, but we decided to go with dropdown menu 
        instead for a number of reasons. First off, Spotify is only available and collects 
        data for roughly half of the world’s countries, so users would not be able to 
        interact with a large portion of the map. Another reason is that the user would 
        have a hard time selecting and filtering the data for smaller countries on the map. 
        We also wanted the user to be able to interact with global data as well. We used a 
        bar graph as our visual encoding because we wanted to show the number of streams 
        for the top 10 songs on any given day and bar graphs are a clear way to display 
        the relationship between different categories and a discrete value. We started 
        with a vertical bar graph, but later switched to a horizontal bar graph because 
        the song labels of the top songs were easier to display and read.
